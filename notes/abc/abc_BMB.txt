intractable likelihoods

(high dimensions, instability?)

* generative model
* sample parameter values from prior
* check match vs. observed data; keep if d(y_i,y) <= epsilon
* how do we measure distance?
need to tune epsilon to get reasonable approximation
high-dimensional data -- distance will be larger -- want *low-dimensional*
summary statistic (ideally sufficient, but impossible in most practical cases)
* ABC: MCMC; use M-H rule based on *priors* conditional on within ranges
  efficient, but can get stuck if proposal distribution is bad ...
* partial rejection -- generate N candidates (particles)
    perturb particles 
    forward, backward transition kernel qf, qb
    keep 'good' particles, assign weights based on prior ratio, perturbation ratio
    efficiency depends on choice of transition kernels, priors

* ABC PMC
   
   

 partial rejection, population (PMC), sequential
