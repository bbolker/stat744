The data in Table 6.3 show percentages of total calories obtained
from complex carbohydrates, for twenty male insulin-dependent diabetics
who had been on a high-carbohydrate diet for six months. Compliance with
the regime was thought to be related to age (in years), body weight 
(relative to "ideal" weight for height) and other components of the diet,
such as the percentage of calories as protein. These other variables are
treated as explanatory variables.
