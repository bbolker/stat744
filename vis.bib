Most researchers present comparisons of MCMC methods using tables of figures of merit; this paper presents a graphical alternative. It first discusses the computation of autocorrelation time, then uses this to construct a figure of merit, log density function evaluations per independent observation. Then, it demonstrates how one can plot this figure of merit against a tuning parameter in a grid of plots where columns represent sampling methods and rows represent distributions. This type of visualization makes it possible to convey a greater depth of information without overwhelming the user with numbers, allowing researchers to put their contributions into a broader context than is possible with a textual presentation.},

This idea, termed effect-ordered data displays, applies principally to the arrangement of unordered factors for quantitative data and frequency data, and to the arrangement of variables and observations in multivariate displays (star plots, parallel coordinate plots, and so forth).

As examples of this principle, we present several techniques for ordering items, levels or variables “optimally”, based on some desired criterion. All of these may be based on eigenvalue or singular-value decompositions.

Along the way, we tell some stories about data display, illustrated by graphs—some surprisingly bad, and some surprisingly good—for showing patterns, trends, and anomalies in data. We hope to raise more questions than we can provide answers for.},

	abstract = {* Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming.


* We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature.


* Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

	abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

From these studies a paradigm that has important applications for practice has begun to emerge. The paradigm is based on elementary codes: Basic geometric and textural aspects of a graph that encode the quantitative information. The methodology that can be invoked to study graphical perception is illustrated by an investigation of the shape parameter of a two-variable graph, a topic that has had much discussion, but little scientific study, for at least 70 years.},

This paper shows that Excel graphics defaults do not embody the appropriate principles. Users who want to use Excel are advised to know the principles of good graphics well enough so that they can choose the appropriate options to override the defaults. Microsoft® should overhaul the Excel graphics engine so that its defaults embody the principles of statistical graphics and make it easy for non-experts to produce good graphs.},
