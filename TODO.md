For 9 Jan:

* JD will create and push repos (find a dongle and a laptop, practice on rstudio)

* BB will present examples prepared for Monday

* Promulgate an assignment, and let them start working on it:
	* Make a repo and share it with us
	* Find some data (consult with us, maybe provide some hints in advance)
		* Data should have _at least_ four variables, with at least one categorical and one continuous variable
	* make 3 ggplots, with good, tidy code and say something about them (use what you've learned from Rauser)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Plan lectures

* scheduling: Alex J. busy Thurs 1 PM, Fri 9 AM
  * Alex B.: Monday 2:30-3:30 and Wednesdays 8:30-10:30.
  * Mu He: Tues 1:30

* code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jrauser/writing/tree/master/how_humans_see_data)

* Put in a low-burden makestuff framework
     * markup shortcut for R packages? (e.g. <#Rpkg #1> -> https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/#1
	 * auto-generate bib products (bib2xhtml or similar)

* Github infrastructure (collecting student repos)

* Start HW early (more structured than 708)
     * HW ideas:
	       * reshape/modify some data
	       * find a graph; recreate it, then fix/change it
		   * convert a table of numbers to a graph
		   * fit a model and diagnose it

    * CSE 707, [Visualization and 3D Rendering](https://computational.mcmaster.ca/graduate-studies/courses.html):
          > This course will provide an introduction to the use of graphics to visualize research data (grids, meshes, particles) in two and three dimensions. It will cover algorithms (surface drawing, transparency), real time visualization, post processing (including large data sets) and generating animations and movies. It will introduce OpenGL as a low-level mechanism to access hardware graphic acceleration as well as other popular toolkits such as vtk and provide experience with visualization tools built on these foundations.
